# Testing ImageDataGenerator

Playing with ImageDataGenerator to view some sample warped images 


## Just learned about "requirements.txt"

From Stackoverflow.com...
 
You can use the following code to generate a requirements.txt file:

pip install pipreqs

pipreqs /path/to/project

If you are given someone else's requirements.txt you can configure your system to comply with those requirements by issuing the following command:

pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
